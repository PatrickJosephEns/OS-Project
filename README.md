My OS-Project contains scripts that automate general admin tasks on an ubuntu Linix server.  

task1.sh  
The perpose of this script is to create users using the values given in the file. The script will need a path to the file containing the users infomation. And you can run it by doing task1.sh pathName.  

task2.sh  
This script compresses the folder then uploads it remotly. So technically its a back up as it uploads a compressed archive of the script. It needs a path to the file to be backed up.
